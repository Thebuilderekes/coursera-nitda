HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. But what does that mean?
Hypertext is text which contains links to other text. Markup refers to tags and elements used within a document.
HTML elements with their opening and closing tags in angle brackets make up an HTML document.

These elements form thestructure of a webpage and describe what to display to the web browser. When it comes to HTML, it's important to know about the purpose of HTML in the web browser. The use of
HTML tags and correct syntax, and how HTML elements are used in a web document. But
what can you do with HTML? You can add images to a web page with HTML code. You can use
it to display data in tables, and you can build forms with a wide range of inputs.

Also, using the correct HTML structure and appropriate elements as a foundation is an essential part of
building accessible websites. HTML can assist in ensuring web accessibility by supporting the
technology people with disabilities use to interact with and understand websites. Another
important concept to know about when you're talking about HTML is the Document Object
Model or DOM. Users need to be able to interact with elements on a web page. This means
that HTML document must be represented in a way that JavaScript code can query and
update it. That's the function of the DOM. It's a model of the objects in your HTML file.

Web developers interact with the DOM through JavaScript to update content, set up events and
animate HTML elements. Now that you've covered the basics of HTML, let's move on to CSS
or Cascading Style Sheets. If HTML is the frame and structure of a building, then CSS is the
paint, wallpaper, fixtures, and overall style. CSS tells the web browser how to display HTML
elements on screen. You use CSS to style elements within an HTML document, create an
appealing layout for your webpage using the box model, and arrange page elements using
normal document flow. That was your HTML and CSS refresher. Now get ready to dive deeper
into learning more about these two topics.
