#Testing

Testing is making sure that everything works as intended.

## Test driven development

This is the process of first writing tests on fuctions or components that do not yet exist. Doing this would make the tests to fail at first but they will eventually start passing when you start to write your component according to the already
written tests.

## Types of testing

End to end testing:
This is Testing the software from the perspective of the end user, e.g of e2e testing frameworks cypress

Integration testing:
Testing how seperate parts of your apps work together. Examples of testing frameworks arereact testing library, enzyme

Unit testing: Testing of smallest unit of testable code like a function.
They are fast to run and easy to write.

## Intro to jest

Code coverage indiciates just how much of the code is covered by testing.

###Mocking
Mocking allows frontend developers to mimick how it would look if data wa to come from the backend
so that they can test the behaviour of the app components or functions
