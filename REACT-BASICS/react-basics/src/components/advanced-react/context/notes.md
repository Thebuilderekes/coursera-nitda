# Important notes on Props, State and Context API

# Props
- Props and state are deterministic. They change and trigger a render update.
- Props are immutable. A component cannot change it's props.


## State
States are a way to allow react to determine when to re-render it's component. AS component managesit's own state internally.
State is optional. You should avoid having too many componets with state.

### Stateless vs stateful components


## Context API
