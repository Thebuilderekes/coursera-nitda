#coursera-nitda

This is a repository that contains notes fromn all my learnings on the coursera e-learning platform. Alot of the notes are going to contain languages and shortforms that might not be clear to all readers so fee free to ask me to clarify anything that seems to vague. I'll be happy to help you underdstand.
